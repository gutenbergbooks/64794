That isn’t quite the thing. (<i>repeating</i>) Ya—oo—oo! That’s more

M<small>RS</small>. M. (<i>throws down her work</i>) This is really intolerable! I
wish you wouldn’t attempt to sing that song, Mr. Mouser. You’ll never
accomplish it.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. I <i>will</i> accomplish it, Mrs. Mouser. Indeed, I may say, I
<i>have</i> accomplished it—all, except the “Ya—oo—oo,” and I’m not
going to be beat by a “Ya—oo—oo,” I can tell you. No, Mrs. Mouser, I’ll
accomplish that “Ya—oo—oo,” if I die for it! (<i>very loud, and out of
tune</i>) “Ya—oo—oo!” No—that’s worse than ever.
</p>
<p class="nobottom">
M<small>RS</small>. M. It’s quite clear that you are determined to annoy me.
</p>
<p class="direction_r_no_top">
(<i>pouting</i>)
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. (<i>comes down quickly; very tenderly</i>) Annoy you? <i>You</i>, my
Anastasia? <i>You?</i> Pooh!
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. I’ve told you a hundred times, Marmaduke, that you haven’t a
single note in your voice.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Then the more creditable in your Marmaduke to try and get a
few. (<i>in a solemn tone</i>) Anastasia, we live in a wonderful age.
Every thing we see above us, below us, and all round about us, proclaims
the triumph of mind over matter.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. (<i>yawns slightly</i>) Well, I don’t deny it, do I?
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. You <i>can’t</i> deny it. Look at the Railroads—oblige me by looking
at the Railroads, with their gigantic viaducts, their stupendous
aqueducts—look at the Electric Telegraph over the Straits of
Menai—look at the Tubular Bridge under the Straits of Dover! And
how—how is this done? By perseverance—by determination! And shall I
flinch from a paltry obstacle? Never! So here goes again! (<i>very loud</i><span class="lftspc">)</span>
“Ya—oo—oo!”
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. (<i>listening</i>) Hark!
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. What?
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. I thought I heard my dear Cousin Crummy outside. But of
course that would give <i>you</i> no gratification.
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[4]</a></span>
M<small>OUS</small>. You wrong me, Anastasia. As long as your Cousin Crummy is
outside, and <i>keeps</i> outside, I don’t care how often I hear him.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. (<i>severely</i>) Mr. Mouser!

M<small>OUS</small>. Understand me, Anastasia, I mean no disrespect to your Cousin
Crummy—on the contrary, Crummy’s a man I like—but Crummy’s like many
other good things in this world, a little of him goes a long way. In
short, he gives us too much of his society.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. Because he sees we are so much alone.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. But we never are alone. Crummy won’t let us be alone.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. Well, isn’t it natural that he should drop in upon us? Isn’t
he your partner in the business? Isn’t he one of the firm, Mouser and
Crummy, Attorneys-at-law?
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Yes, and why? Because you chose to fancy that my practice was
more than I could get through, and that I required a partner.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. I confess I did, and you took him in.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. I beg your pardon—he took <i>me</i> in; and pretty considerably
too, for he pockets half the profits, and leaves me all the work.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. How can you say so? Isn’t he gone out on business now—and all
the way to Pentonville, too?
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. All the way from Islington to Pentonville!
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. Then why didn’t you go yourself<span class="lftspc">?</span> (<i>rises</i>)
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. And leave <i>you</i>, my ’Stasia? (<i>tenderly</i>) You that I
adore with a degree of intensity closely bordering on insanity! Besides,
it isn’t because a Mrs. Jones from Northamptonshire—a Jones I don’t
know—a Jones I never saw—a Jones I never even heard of, chooses to send
for me, that therefore I must go to that Jones, Jones can’t expect
it!
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. (<small>R</small>.) But no doubt she wishes to consult you on business, and
she might prove an excellent client.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. (<small>L</small>.) I hate business! I hate clients! I hate everything in the
world but you, my ’Stasia. What’s the world to me? Nothing! What are its
“gay and festive scenes, its halls of dazzling light” to me? Nothing!
Oh, ’Stasia! ’Stasia!
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. What nonsense you talk. One would suppose we had only been
married a week instead of a year. Has any one been here for me?
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. (<i>eagerly</i>) Any one! Not that I know of. Who do you
expect?
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. Why only the laundress with my veil. She promised faithfully
to let me have it to-day. When you go out, perhaps you will just call,
and say I’m waiting for it. It’s only just over the way.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Of course, if you insist upon it, I will. But perhaps you’re
not aware that there are usually from thirty to forty females of various
ages and dimensions engaged in that establishment <i>over the way</i>,
and I don’t think it would be exactly the safest place in the world for
an unprotected male. Besides, I might be seen entering the premises,
and then what would people say? Am I not known in the neighbourhood as
the best of husbands? When<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[5]</a></span> we go out don’t the people rush to their
doors and windows to look at us? Oh, ’Stasy! ’Stasy!
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. Ha, ha, ha! My dear Marmaduke, you are certainly getting a
little cracked on the subject.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. I know it. I’m so much cracked that I wonder I don’t fall to
pieces. But I can’t help it. (<i>placing his arm round her
waist</i>)
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. (<i>without</i>, <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>D</small>.&nbsp;<small>F</small>.) Oh, Mouser’s at home, is he?
Particularly engaged, d’ye say? Pooh, pooh! I know better.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. (<i>aside</i>) I shall do Crummy a terrific injury some of
these days. I’m sure I shall.
</p>
<p class="entrance">
<i>Enter</i> C<small>RUMMY</small>, <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>D</small>.&nbsp;<small>F</small>.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. (<i>advancing to</i> M<small>OUSER</small>, <small>C</small>., <i>and giving him a slap on the
back</i>) Ah, Mouser, my boy—sure to find you at home, eh? Ha, ha!
Always together, eh? Billing and cooing, and all that sort of thing, eh?
(<i>giving</i> M<small>OUSER</small> <i>a poke in the side</i>) By-the-bye, I’ve just come
from Mrs. Major-General Jones. She would have nothing to say to me.
She insists on seeing the head of the firm, so I told you’d be with her
in a quarter of an hour.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. (<small>R</small>.) Did you? Then you had better go back to Mrs. Jones, and
tell her that I shan’t do anything of the sort.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. (<small>C</small>.) But you <i>must</i>. Her’s is a very important case.
Neither more nor less than a separation from her husband, Major-General
Jones.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. I’ll have nothing to do with it. Major-General Jones has never
offended me—what right, then, have I to stand between Major-General
Jones and Mrs. Major-General Jones, and say to Major-General Jones,
“Major-General Jones, take a last look at Mrs. Major-General Jones, for
you’ll never set your eyes on Mrs. Major-General Jones again?” It’s
absurd!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. But he ill-treats her—games, drinks, squanders her fortune—and,
they do say, is not particular as to the number of his attachments.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. (<i>with a look of horror</i>) ’Stasy, can such things be?
(<i>drags off his dressing gown, which he throws into</i> C<small>RUMMY</small>’<small>S</small>
<i>face, who places it on back of chair</i>, <small>R</small>. <i>of table.</i>) My
coat—my hat—my blue bag—quick! (C<small>RUMMY</small> <i>exits into office</i>, <small>R</small>.&nbsp;<small>D</small>.&nbsp;<small>F</small>.)
Oh, the monster! But I’ll hold him up to the execration of mankind.
“Not particular as to the number of his attachments!” Gracious goodness!
And to think that such a man is able to walk the streets without a
policeman on each side of him. (C<small>RUMMY</small> <i>returns with hat, coat, and
blue bag</i>) But, as I said before, I’ll expose him! (<i>in his
excitement he puts on the dressing gown again—puts on</i> C<small>RUMMY</small>’<small>S</small>
<i>hat, and takes</i> C<small>RUMMY</small>’<small>S</small> <i>umbrella from table</i>) I shan’t be
long, my ’Stasia. I shall soon return on the wings of love——
(<i>going</i>)
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. (<small>L</small>., <i>detaining him</i>) You’re surely not going out in
your dressing gown?
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Eh? yes—it is my dressing gown, I declare. On second thoughts,
I really don’t see why I should interfere between these Joneses.
(<i>places hat and umbrella on the table</i>) I’d rather by half stop
with you, my ’Stasy.
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[6]</a></span>
C<small>RUM</small>. Nonsense. You must go. Mrs. Major-General Jones expects you.
(<i>taking hold of one of the sleeves of the dressing gown</i>)
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. (<i>taking hold of the other</i>) Of course—Mrs. Jones
expects you.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. You wouldn’t keep a young and pretty woman waiting?
(<i>handing him his coat</i>)
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Oh, she’s young and pretty, is she? You hear, ’Stasia—she’s
young and pretty. (<i>puts on coat</i>) You expose me to her
fascinations, ’Stasia——
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. (<i>smiling</i>) I’m not at all afraid.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. And why—why are you not afraid? Because, as you must have
observed, you no sooner set your foot on the ground than I instantly
commence adoring the bit of ground you set your foot on.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. (<i>with impatience</i>) Yes, yes—but make haste. And you can
join me at my sister Charlotte’s. You know we drink tea there this
evening——
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Yes, at eight o’clock. But it isn’t five yet.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. What of that? I promised her to come early—she’s teaching me
a new pattern in knitting.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Yes, I heard her the other day. She was telling you to drop
one, and then take up two. She didn’t say what, but I must say I was
rather surprised at her requesting you to “turn over twice”—especially
so soon after dinner.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. Ha, ha, ha! Good-bye—for I’m in a hurry to dress.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. (<i>detaining her</i>) One fond embrace before we part!
(<i>kisses her</i>) Keep up your spirits in my absence.
(<i>going—stops</i>) Another fond embrace before we part!
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. (<i>with evident impatience</i>) Psha! (M<small>OUSER</small> <i>going
again</i>) You’ll not forget the message about the veil——
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Certainly not. (<i>going—stops</i>) Another fond embrace
before——
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Go along! (<i>pushes him out</i>, <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>D</small>.&nbsp;<small>F</small>.) Well, coz, you
certainly may say you’ve got the most attentive husband in the
world.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. Too attentive by half!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Eh?
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. (<i>seriously</i>) Yes, cousin. Few women are proof against
ridicule—and some husbands would do well to remember that there is a
point when attention to a wife becomes a burden, and even affection a
persecution. Yes, yes, cousin—he’s too attentive by half!
</p>
<p class="direction_r">
<i>Exit</i>, <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>D</small>.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. “Too attentive by half!” Then it is as I feared, and that
simpleton, Mouser, doesn’t see that he is persecuting his wife with his
affection. She evidently dreads a conjugal <i>tête-à-tête</i>, and no
wonder. He never leaves her for a moment; but there he is, eternally and
everlastingly at her side, “sighing like furnace,” and making himself
ridiculous in her eyes. Mischief will certainly come of it. Some remedy
must be devised. But what? If I could only contrive to excite
Anastasia’s suspicions that her<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[7]</a></span> husband, like Major-General Jones, is
not exactly satisfied with one attachment at a time——By this means her
jealousy might be roused. But she wouldn’t believe <i>me</i>. No,
Mouser himself must supply the materials. But how? (B<small>ETSY</small> B<small>AKER</small>
<i>knocks at</i> <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>D</small>.&nbsp;<small>F</small>.) Come in!
</p>
<p class="entrance">
B<small>ETSY</small> <i>appears at</i> <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>D</small>.&nbsp;<small>F</small>., <i>with a small parcel.</i>
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. Mrs. Mouser’s veil——
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Come in, my dear.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. Pattens and all, sir?
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. No. You may leave them outside.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. If it’s the same to you, sir, I’d rather not.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Then take them off, at all events.
</p>
<p class="nobottom">
B<small>ET</small>. Of course, sir. (<i>takes off her pattens, and comes forward,
carrying them in her hand</i><span class="lftspc">)</span> It isn’t likely I should go for to walk
on a carpet, especially when the roads are so dreadful muddy.
</p>
<p class="direction_r_no_top">
(<i>putting her pattens down on table with a slam</i>)
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Zounds! Don’t put ’em on the table! (<i>takes pattens from
her</i>)
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. I’m sure I don’t know what to do with ’em, so put ’em where you
like.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Ha, ha! Heyday! I think I ought to know that face again.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. If you ever saw it before, you certainly ought.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Have I not met you rather frequently of late, walking of an
evening with our young clerk, Joseph Harris?
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. Yes, sir. We’ve rather delicate constitutions both of us, so we
generally go out for a little fresh air and exercise every Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, after work hours. We
can’t get out any other evenings, sir. I suppose, you’re Mr. Crummy!
You’re not Mr. Mouser. We all know <i>him!</i>
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. We! Who?
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. Why, all us girls at the laundry over the way. Ah, there’s a
pattern for a husband! ’Tisn’t every woman, sir, as gets a Mouser. No,
sir—Mousers are scarce.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. And yet you’d take your chance and marry Joseph Harris?
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. Just try me! And now I think of it, sir, he has told me more
than once that you said if ever he found a nice, genteel, respectable
young woman that he’d like to marry, you’d do something for him,
sir.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Oh, then, you, I suppose, are the——
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. The young woman? Yes, sir, Elizabeth Baker, the youngest of
sixteen sisters, and all of ’em girls, sir—and hard-working girls, too,
sir. It’s worth going over to our laundry to see us, sir. Fancy sixteen
Bakers a washing, all of a row!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Well, I’ll bear my promise in mind.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. Don’t you think you’d better get it off your mind at once, sir?
There’s a nice little shop in the greengrocery line, to be let<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[8]</a></span> at the
corner of the street—and, as Harris doesn’t seem very fond of
the law, it would be just the very thing for us.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Egad, here’s an opportunity for driving a
bargain. She’s a smart little body enough, and if she can only be
induced to act as I direct—I’ll feel the ground at all events.
(<i>aloud</i><span class="lftspc">)</span> I suppose you’ve brought Mrs. Mouser’s veil? (<i>pointing
to parcel</i>)
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. Yes, sir.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Mr. Mouser called and told <i>you</i> to do so, eh?
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. He didn’t address himself to any of us in particular, sir. He
just popped his head in at the door, and said, “Mrs. Mouser wants her
veil directly,” and then took to his heels as if he was frightened to
look at any woman but his wife. Lor! what a happy couple they must
be!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. (<i>with a deep sigh</i>) Happy! (<i>solemnly</i>) They are <i>not</i>
a happy couple!
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. Lawks!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Yet they might be—but, unfortunately, there is only one person
in the world who could make them so.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. And who is that?
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. You.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. (<i>with a jump</i>) Me! I’m sure I’ll set about it directly, if
you’ll only tell me how.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. I will. (<i>looks mysteriously about him—</i>B<small>ETSY</small> <i>watches
him with astonishment—then in a loud whisper</i>) You must fall in love
with Mr. Mouser.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. Sir!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. And Mr. Mouser must instantly fall in love with you.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. (<i>staring at him—then with dignity</i>) Give me my pattens,
sir, and let me go. Give me my pattens, I say.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. ’Pshaw, child! You misunderstand me. Listen! Your sudden
passion for Mouser——
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. (<i>seizing hold of them, and trying to pull them out of</i>
C<small>RUMMY</small>’<small>S</small> <i>hand</i><span class="lftspc">)</span>
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Oh! Very well! It’s a pity, too—for a married couple might do
very well.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. My pattens!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. At that little greengrocer’s shop at the corner of the
street.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. My pat—(<i>letting go the pattens</i>) Well, they’re not worth
making a piece of work about.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. (<i>smiling</i>) Oh! Then as I was going to say—your passion
for Mouser, will, of course, be merely assumed, but you must contrive to
make him fall in love with you, in downright earnest.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. I can’t do it, sir. I wouldn’t mind trying, if I wasn’t such a
dragon of virtue—but I’m sorry to say I am.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Then somebody else will.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. But if he should happen to captivate me?
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. That’s your affair.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. But why—why am I to do all this?
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. That’s my affair.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. (<small>L</small>.) But what will Mrs. Mouser say?
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-9">[9]</a></span>
C<small>RUM</small>. That’s her affair.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. But she’ll go and imagine all sorts of things.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. I hope she will. Come, is it a bargain? Will you have Joseph
Harris, and the little greengrocer’s shop, or will you take your pattens
and go? (<i>offering them</i>)
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. You can keep the pattens.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Spoken like a sensible girl. (<i>places patterns in
passage</i>, <small>L</small>.<small>C</small>.) I expect Mouser every minute.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. Oh lud! (<i>about to run off</i><span class="lftspc">)</span>
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Don’t run away. (<i>stopping her</i>)
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. But, consider, sir, you can’t expect me to act a part at a
moment’s notice.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Then take that veil to Mrs. Mouser, and in a few minutes you
can come back, but be sure you <i>do</i> come back!

Don Juan! (<i>poking him in the side</i>)

C<small>RUM</small>. But I really think you might have waited till I was out of the

<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Before I what, sir?
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. You know—this sort of thing, eh? (<i>winking at</i> M<small>OUSER</small>) I
suppose you thought I shouldn’t see you do it, eh?
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Do it. Do what?
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Wink at her.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. (<i>with grandeur</i>) Mr. Crummy!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. That’s right—brazen it out—but let me tell you, sir, I have had
my eye upon you and that young woman for some time past.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Oh, damn it, I can’t stand this! you forget that you’re a
junior partner, sir.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. And you forget that I’m your wife’s cousin, sir—yes, sir! And
I’ll not allow you to impose upon her with your pretended affection, you
good-for-nothing little hypocrite you, while you carry on an intrigue
under her very nose, sir.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Nose, sir.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. No, sir! Neither will I suffer you to trifle with the feelings
of one that I’m determined shall not fall into the trap you have<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[10]</a></span> laid,
sir. You know who I mean—Baker, sir! (<i>going round him in front to</i> <small>L</small>.)
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. <i>I</i> trifle with the feelings of a Baker! I lay a trap for
a Baker! You’re talking nonsense, Crummy!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Come, come. Now that you see I’ve found you out—tell me how you
contrived to wheedle poor Betsy out of her affections?
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Crummy, I’m not apt to make use of strong language—but—by the
living jingo, I never wheedled a Betsy out of anything in all my
life!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Well, I suppose I must believe you. But, intentionally or not,
you certainly have made a most powerful impression on her youthful
heart! She confessed as much to me just now.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. (<i>gradually dropping his look of indignation, and with
self-satisfaction</i>) Poor Betsy! I’m very sorry for her, I’m sure! I
say, Crummy, she’s a niceish little sort of a girl enough.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Umph! so, so! (<i>in a contemptuous tone</i>)
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. So, so! No, let’s be just, Crummy—let’s be just. She has good
eyes, Crummy, umph?
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. (<small>L</small>.) Squints a little.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Does she? I’ve never noticed her in the slightest degree
whatever—but I’m damned if she squints!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. At any rate her eyes seem good enough to have noticed
<i>you.</i> But, knowing you to be free from blame in the matter, I
reasoned with her, told her the folly of fixing her affections upon a
married man, but all in vain—so <i>you’d</i> better take her in
hand.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Do you think so?

asked you to meet him here——
</p>

thirty-seven female voices, including Big Charlotte’s, crying out,
“Lawks!” at the same moment? Of course, I was obliged to clear myself,
which I did, by telling them the whole business! How it was to oblige
you, that I was trying to make Mr. Mouser fall in love with me; because
as how you promised to give the little greengrocer’s shop at the corner
of the street to the young woman that succeeded in captivating him.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Well?
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. Well, sir—the words were no sooner out of my mouth, than all the
washing-tubs were deserted in a moment, and the whole of the
thirty-seven girls—Big Charlotte included—seemed determined to set
about captivating Mr. Mouser at once—and, as ill-luck would have it, he
passed by the window at that moment, sir—and they all instantly rushed
out after him, in a body.

M<small>OUS</small>. Hush! (<i>trying to pacify her</i>) You’re wrong, Betsy, but
you don’t know what it is to have a young and lovely wife, Betsy.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. Yes I do.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. No you don’t, and what’s more, you probably never will. And so,
Betsy—that is—I mean—I say—I mean—(<i>aside</i>)—I can’t make up my mind
as to what I <i>do</i> mean.
</p>
<p class="direction_c">

they should come in that way. (<i>goes off</i>, <small>R</small>.&nbsp;<small>D</small>.&nbsp;<small>F.</small>)
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. (<i>suddenly leaving off sobbing</i>) I’m horribly afraid the
little shop at the corner of the street, will slip through my fingers at
last. (<i>double knock at street door</i>) Oh, gemini! Who can that be?
What’ll become of me?

M<small>RS</small>. M. Is Mr. Mouser at home?
</p>
<p>
B<small>OY</small>. No, ma’am.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. Bring candles.
</p>
<p>
B<small>OY</small>. Yes, ma’am.
</p>
<p class="direction_hang2">
(B<small>OY</small> <i>goes off and returns immediately with candles, which he

</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. Good gracious! What a commotion! There are at least thirty
women round the door! I’m quite alarmed! I feel I was wrong to leave the
house in a pet against Mr. Mouser. As for my Cousin Crummy’s
insinuations, I treat them with the utmost contempt. So, instead of
spending the evening with sister Charlotte, I determined to return home,
and give my poor dear affectionate little husband an agreeable
surprise.

<p class="nobottom">
M<small>OUS</small>. Yes, my wig. This is your doing—this is your precious work.
(<i>seizing</i> C<small>RUMMY</small> <i>and shaking him</i>) It was you—you who
exposed me to the fascinations of this juvenile washerwoman. It’s

<i>nudges her—then suddenly</i>) Ha, ha, ha!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. (<i>crosses</i> <small>L</small>.&nbsp;<small>C</small>.) I must explain after all, I
see—Anastasia Mouser, not an hour since—and in terms as forcible as they
were pathetic—you brought a grave and heavy charge against your
husband.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. (<i>aside to</i> C<small>RUMMY</small>, <i>and rapidly</i>) Hush!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. Yes, Anastasia Mouser—and that charge was, that he was “<i>too
attentive by half.</i>” It almost broke his heart. Didn’t it,
Mouser?
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. (<i>affecting pathos</i>) As near as a toucher!
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. But suddenly a smile lighted up his benevolent
countenance—(M<small>OUSER</small> <i>smiles</i>)—and he said to me, “Crummy, I’ve an
idea.” Didn’t you, Mouser?
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Yes, I distinctly said, “Crummy, I’ve an idea.”
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. I’ll swear to it. I heard him.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. (<i>suddenly</i>) I see it all.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. (<i>aside</i>) That’s lucky. I’m damned if I do.
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. And I determined to teach you this lesson—that the wife, who
could complain of too much attention from a husband, could only be cured
of her error by being led to suspect that that affection was bestowed on
another. (<i>gets round behind to</i> <small>R</small>.)
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. Exactly.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. Then you have succeeded—for though, Marmaduke, you may love
me a thousand times better than ever—I’ll never complain again.
(<i>embracing</i> M<small>OUSER</small>)
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. On these conditions, I forgive you.
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. My dear Cousin Crummy, what do I not owe you?
</p>
<p>
C<small>RUM</small>. First, pay your debts here. (<i>taking</i> B<small>ETSY</small> <i>by the

</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. And how can I serve you?
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. By allowing me to serve you—the best of vegetables, and fresh
oysters every day.
</p>
<p>
M<small>OUS</small>. We’ll certainly deal with you. Eh, ’Stasy?
</p>
<p>
M<small>RS</small>. M. But I’ll go to market.
</p>
<p>
B<small>ET</small>. (<i>to audience</i>) Do, ma’am—and I hope you will only be one
out of many customers, at our new shop, where by a supply of the best
articles we can get—joined with attention, civility, and moderate
prices, we hope to secure the patronage of the Nobility, Gentry, and the
Public in general.

This transcription is based on two sets of scans of the Lacy edition.
The first is available through the Internet Archive from a copy held
by the University of Warwick:

<p class="link"><a

The second, available through the Hathi Digital Library, is from a
copy of Volume 8 of Lacy’s Acting Edition of Plays from the University
of Michigan:

<p class="noindent">
The text of <i>Betsy Barker!</i> begins on page 302 of the scans. Other than
differences in Lacy’s business address on the title page and
information about the printer at the end, the text of the two scan sets
appears to be the same. Because of issues related to publication, the
condition of the scanned copies, and the scanning process itself, both
sets were used for the transcription.
</p>
<p class="tnote">
The following changes were made to the text:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Title page: Milliner’s Holiday—Changed to “Milliners’ Holiday”, the
correct title of the play.
</li>
<li>
p. 3: I thought I heard my dear Cousin Crummy outside—Added a period
to the end of the sentence.
</li>
<li>
p. 5: <i>who places it on back of chair</i>, <small>R</small>. <i>of table.</i>—Added a
closing parenthesis.
</li>
<li>
p. 7: ’Tisn’t every woman, sir, as get’s a Mouser.—Changed “get’s” to
“gets”.
</li>
<li>
p. 9: but it won’t do do—ugh! you Don Juan!—Deleted the second “do”.
</li>
<li>
p. 9: C<small>RUM</small>. Wink at her,—Changed the comma at the end of
the line to a period.
</li>
<li>
p. 10: C<small>RUM</small>. Umph! so, so: (<i>in a contemptuous tone</i>)—Changed colon
to an exclamation mark.
</li>
<li>
p. 12: such as John, and Timothy, and Marma<i>dook</i>—Added a period
after “Marma<i>dook</i>”.
</li>
<li>
p. 12: M<small>OUS</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Mouser, be firm—Added a period after “firm”.
</li>
<li>
p. 13: (<i>rushes at</i> B<small>ETSY</small>—<i>she avoids him, leaving the veil in
his hand.</i>—Changed the period after “<i>hand</i><span class="lftspc">”</span> to a closing parenthesis for
consistency.
</li>
<li>
p. 15: (<i>great noise of</i> W<small>OMEN</small>’<small>S</small> <i>voices suddenly heard</i>—Changed
“<i>great</i><span class="lftspc">”</span> to “<i>Great</i><span class="lftspc">”</span>.
</li>
<li>
p. 18: Young woman, speak this moment (<i>angrily</i>)—Added an exclamation
mark after “moment”.
</li>

Some inconsistencies, such as the inconsistent hyphenation of the
phrase “by the bye” and the different spellings of “pshaw”, have not
been standardized.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
